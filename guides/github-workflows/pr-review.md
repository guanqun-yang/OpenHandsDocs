# PR Review

The reference workflow is available [here](https://github.com/OpenHands/agent-sdk/tree/main/examples/03_github_workflows/02_pr_review)!

Automatically review pull requests, providing feedback on code quality, security, and best practices. Reviews can be triggered in two ways:

- Requesting `openhands-agent` as a reviewer
- Adding the `review-this` label to the PR

The reference workflow triggers on either the "review-this" label or when the `openhands-agent` account is requested as a reviewer. In OpenHands organization repositories, `openhands-agent` has access, so this works as-is. In your own repositories, requesting `openhands-agent` will only work if that account is added as a collaborator or is part of a team with access. If you don't plan to grant access, use the label trigger instead, or change the condition to a reviewer handle that exists in your repo.

## Quick Start

1. **Copy workflow to your repository**

```bash
cp examples/03_github_workflows/02_pr_review/workflow.yml .github/workflows/pr-review.yml
```

2. **Configure secrets in GitHub**

Go to GitHub Settings → Secrets and add `LLM_API_KEY` (get from https://docs.openhands.dev/openhands/usage/llms/openhands-llms).

3. **(Optional) Create a `review-this` label in your repository**

Go to Issues → Labels → New label and create a `review-this` label.

You can also trigger reviews by requesting `openhands-agent` as a reviewer.

## Features

- **Fast Reviews** - Results posted on the PR in only 2 or 3 minutes
- **Comprehensive Analysis** - Analyzes the changes given the repository context. Covers code quality, security, best practices
- **GitHub Integration** - Posts comments directly to the PR

## Security

Users with write access (maintainers) can trigger reviews by requesting `openhands-agent` as a reviewer or adding the `review-this` label. Maintainers need to read the PR to make sure it's safe to run.

## Reference Workflow

This example is available on GitHub: `examples/03_github_workflows/02_pr_review/`

# 1. Copy this file to .github/workflows/pr-review.yml in your repository
# 2. Add your LLM_API_KEY to the repository secrets
# 3. Commit this file to your repository
# 4. Trigger the review by either:
#    - Adding the "review-this" label to any PR, OR
#    - Requesting openhands-agent as a reviewer
