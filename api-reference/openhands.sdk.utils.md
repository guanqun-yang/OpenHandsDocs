# openhands.sdk.utils

Utility functions for the OpenHands SDK.

## Functions

### deprecated()
Return a decorator that deprecates a callable with explicit metadata. Use this helper when you can annotate a function, method, or property with @deprecated(…). It transparently forwards to deprecation.deprecated() while filling in the SDK's current version metadata unless custom values are supplied.

### maybe_truncate()
Truncate the middle of content if it exceeds the specified length. Keeps the head and tail of the content to preserve context at both ends. Optionally saves the full content to a file for later investigation.

**Parameters:**
- `content` – The text content to potentially truncate
- `truncate_after` – Maximum length before truncation. If None, no truncation occurs
- `truncate_notice` – Notice to insert in the middle when content is truncated
- `save_dir` – Working directory to save full content file in
- `tool_prefix` – Prefix for the saved file (e.g., "bash", "browser", "editor")

**Returns:** Original content if under limit, or truncated content with head and tail preserved and reference to saved file if applicable

### sanitize_openhands_mentions()
Sanitize @OpenHands mentions in text to prevent self-mention loops. This function inserts a zero-width joiner (ZWJ) after the @ symbol in @OpenHands mentions, making them non-clickable in GitHub comments while preserving readability. The original case of the mention is preserved.

**Parameters:**
- `text` – The text to sanitize

**Returns:** Text with sanitized @OpenHands mentions (e.g., "@OpenHands" -> "@‍OpenHands")

### Examples

```python
>>> sanitize_openhands_mentions("Thanks @OpenHands for the help!")
'Thanks @‍OpenHands for the help!'

>>> sanitize_openhands_mentions("Check @openhands and @OPENHANDS")
'Check @‍openhands and @‍OPENHANDS'

>>> sanitize_openhands_mentions("No mention here")
'No mention here'
```

---

### warn_deprecated()
Emit a deprecation warning for dynamic access to a legacy feature. Prefer this helper when a decorator is not practical—e.g. attribute accessors, data migrations, or other runtime paths that must conditionally warn. Provide explicit version metadata so the SDK reports consistent messages and upgrades to deprecation.UnsupportedWarning after the removal threshold.
