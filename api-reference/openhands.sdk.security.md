# openhands.sdk.security

## class SecurityRisk
Bases: str, Enum

Security risk levels for actions. Based on OpenHands security risk levels but adapted for agent-sdk. Integer values allow for easy comparison and ordering.

### Properties

- **description**: str - Get a human-readable description of the risk level.
- **visualize**: Text - Return Rich Text representation of this risk level.

### Methods

#### HIGH = 'HIGH'

#### LOW = 'LOW'

#### MEDIUM = 'MEDIUM'

#### UNKNOWN = 'UNKNOWN'

#### get_color()
Get the color for displaying this risk level in Rich text.

#### is_riskier()
Check if this risk level is riskier than another. Risk levels follow the natural ordering: LOW is less risky than MEDIUM, which is less risky than HIGH. UNKNOWN is not comparable to any other level.

To make this act like a standard well-ordered domain, we reflexively consider risk levels to be riskier than themselves:

```python
for risk_level in list(SecurityRisk):
    assert risk_level.is_riskier(risk_level)
```

More concretely:

```python
assert SecurityRisk.HIGH.is_riskier(SecurityRisk.HIGH)
assert SecurityRisk.MEDIUM.is_riskier(SecurityRisk.MEDIUM)
assert SecurityRisk.LOW.is_riskier(SecurityRisk.LOW)
```

This can be disabled by setting the reflexive parameter to False.

**Parameters:**
- `other` (SecurityRisk) – The other risk level to compare against.
- `reflexive` (bool) – Whether the relationship is reflexive.

**Raises:** ValueError – If either risk level is UNKNOWN.
