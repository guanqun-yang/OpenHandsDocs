## class BaseConversation
Bases: ABC

Abstract base class for conversation implementations. This class defines the interface that all conversation implementations must follow. Conversations manage the interaction between users and agents, handling message exchange, execution control, and state management.

### Properties

- **confirmation_policy_active**: bool
- **conversation_stats**: ConversationStats
- **id**: UUID
- **is_confirmation_mode_active**: bool - Check if confirmation mode is active. Returns True if BOTH conditions are met:
  - The conversation state has a security analyzer set (not None)
  - The confirmation policy is active
- **state**: ConversationStateProtocol

### Methods

#### init()
Initialize the base conversation with span tracking.

#### abstractmethod ask_agent()
Ask the agent a simple, stateless question and get a direct LLM response. This bypasses the normal conversation flow and does not modify, persist, or become part of the conversation state. The request is not remembered by the main agent, no events are recorded, and execution status is untouched. It is also thread-safe and may be called while conversation.run() is executing in another thread.

**Parameters:**
- `question` – A simple string question to ask the agent

**Returns:** A string response from the agent

#### abstractmethod close()

#### static compose_callbacks()
Compose multiple callbacks into a single callback function.

**Parameters:**
- `callbacks` – An iterable of callback functions

**Returns:** A single callback function that calls all provided callbacks

#### abstractmethod condense()
Force condensation of the conversation history. This method uses the existing condensation request pattern to trigger condensation. It adds a CondensationRequest event to the conversation and forces the agent to take a single step to process it. The condensation will be applied immediately and will modify the conversation state by adding a condensation event to the history.

**Raises:** ValueError – If no condenser is configured or the condenser doesn't handle condensation requests.

#### abstractmethod generate_title()
Generate a title for the conversation based on the first user message.

**Parameters:**
- `llm` – Optional LLM to use for title generation. If not provided, uses the agent's LLM.
- `max_length` – Maximum length of the generated title.

**Returns:** A generated title for the conversation.

**Raises:** ValueError – If no user messages are found in the conversation.

#### static get_persistence_dir()
Get the persistence directory for the conversation.

**Parameters:**
- `persistence_base_dir` – Base directory for persistence. Can be a string path or Path object.
- `conversation_id` – Unique conversation ID.

**Returns:** String path to the conversation-specific persistence directory. Always returns a normalized string path even if a Path was provided.

#### abstractmethod pause()

#### abstractmethod reject_pending_actions()

#### abstractmethod run()
Execute the agent to process messages and perform actions. This method runs the agent until it finishes processing the current message or reaches the maximum iteration limit.

#### abstractmethod send_message()
Send a message to the agent.

**Parameters:**
- `message` – Either a string (which will be converted to a user message) or a Message object
- `sender` – Optional identifier of the sender. Can be used to track message origin in multi-agent scenarios. For example, when one agent delegates to another, the sender can be set to identify which agent is sending the message.

#### abstractmethod set_confirmation_policy()
Set the confirmation policy for the conversation.

#### abstractmethod set_security_analyzer()
Set the security analyzer for the conversation.

#### abstractmethod update_secrets()

## class Conversation
Bases: object

Factory class for creating conversation instances with OpenHands agents. This factory automatically creates either a LocalConversation or RemoteConversation based on the workspace type provided. LocalConversation runs the agent locally, while RemoteConversation connects to a remote agent server.

**Returns:** LocalConversation if workspace is local, RemoteConversation if workspace is remote.

### Example

```python
from openhands.sdk import LLM, Agent, Conversation

llm = LLM(model="claude-sonnet-4-20250514", api_key=SecretStr("key"))
agent = Agent(llm=llm, tools=[])
conversation = Conversation(agent=agent, workspace="./workspace")
conversation.send_message("Hello!")
conversation.run()
```

---

## class ConversationExecutionStatus
Bases: str, Enum

Enum representing the current execution state of the conversation.

### Methods

#### block_action()
Persistently record a hook-blocked action.

#### block_message()
Persistently record a hook-blocked user message.

#### classmethod create()
Create a new conversation state or resume from persistence. This factory method handles both new conversation creation and resumption from persisted state.

**New conversation:** The provided Agent is used directly. Pydantic validation happens via the cls() constructor.

**Restored conversation:** The provided Agent is validated against the persisted agent using agent.load(). Tools must match (they may have been used in conversation history), but all other configuration can be freely changed: LLM, agent_context, condenser, system prompts, etc.

**Parameters:**
- `id` – Unique conversation identifier
- `agent` – The Agent to use (tools must match persisted on restore)
- `workspace` – Working directory for agent operations
- `persistence_dir` – Directory for persisting state and events
- `max_iterations` – Maximum iterations per run
- `stuck_detection` – Whether to enable stuck detection
- `cipher` – Optional cipher for encrypting/decrypting secrets in persisted state. If provided, secrets are encrypted when saving and decrypted when loading. If not provided, secrets are redacted (lost) on serialization.

**Returns:** ConversationState ready for use

**Raises:**
- ValueError – If conversation ID or tools mismatch on restore
- ValidationError – If agent or other fields fail Pydantic validation

#### static get_unmatched_actions()
Find actions in the event history that don't have matching observations. This method identifies ActionEvents that don't have corresponding ObservationEvents or UserRejectObservations, which typically indicates actions that are pending confirmation or execution.

**Parameters:**
- `events` – List of events to search through

**Returns:** List of ActionEvent objects that don't have corresponding observations, in chronological order

#### locked()
Return True if the lock is currently held by any thread.

#### model_config
Configuration for the model, should be a dictionary conforming to [ConfigDict][pydantic.config.ConfigDict].

#### model_post_init()
This function is meant to behave like a BaseModel method to initialise private attributes. It takes context as an argument since that's what pydantic-core passes when calling it.

**Parameters:**
- `self` – The BaseModel instance.
- `context` – The context.

#### owned()
Return True if the lock is currently held by the calling thread.

#### pop_blocked_action()
Remove and return a hook-blocked action reason, if present.

#### pop_blocked_message()
Remove and return a hook-blocked message reason, if present.

#### release()
Release the lock.

**Raises:** RuntimeError – If the current thread doesn't own the lock.

#### set_on_state_change()
Set a callback to be called when state changes.

**Parameters:**
- `callback` – A function that takes an Event (ConversationStateUpdateEvent) or None to remove the callback

---

## class ConversationVisualizerBase
Bases: ABC

Base class for conversation visualizers. This abstract base class defines the interface that all conversation visualizers must implement. Visualizers can be created before the Conversation is initialized and will be configured with the conversation state automatically.

The typical usage pattern:
- Create a visualizer instance: `viz = MyVisualizer()`
- Pass it to Conversation: `conv = Conversation(agent, visualizer=viz)`
- Conversation automatically calls `viz.initialize(state)` to attach the state

You can also pass the uninstantiated class if you don't need extra args for initialization, and Conversation will create it:
```python
conv = Conversation(agent, visualizer=MyVisualizer)
```
Conversation will then call `MyVisualizer()` followed by `initialize(state)`

### Properties

- **conversation_stats**: ConversationStats | None - Get conversation stats from the state.

### Methods

#### init()
Initialize the visualizer base.

#### create_sub_visualizer()
Create a visualizer for a sub-agent during delegation. Override this method to support sub-agent visualization in multi-agent delegation scenarios. The sub-visualizer will be used to display events from the spawned sub-agent. By default, returns None which means sub-agents will not have visualization. Subclasses that support delegation (like DelegationVisualizer) should override this method to create appropriate sub-visualizers.

**Parameters:**
- `agent_id` – The identifier of the sub-agent being spawned

**Returns:** A visualizer instance for the sub-agent, or None if sub-agent visualization is not supported

#### final initialize()
Initialize the visualizer with conversation state. This method is called by Conversation after the state is created, allowing the visualizer to access conversation stats and other state information. Subclasses should not override this method, to ensure the state is set.

**Parameters:**
- `state` – The conversation state object

#### abstractmethod on_event()
Handle a conversation event. This method is called for each event in the conversation and should implement the visualization logic.

**Parameters:**
- `event` – The event to visualize

---

## class DefaultConversationVisualizer
Bases: ConversationVisualizerBase

Handles visualization of conversation events with Rich formatting. Provides Rich-formatted output with semantic dividers and complete content display.

### Methods

#### init()
Initialize the visualizer.

**Parameters:**
- `highlight_regex` – Dictionary mapping regex patterns to Rich color styles for highlighting keywords in the visualizer. For example: (configuration object)
- `skip_user_messages` – If True, skip displaying user messages. Useful for scenarios where user input is not relevant to show.

#### on_event()
Main event handler that displays events with Rich formatting.

---

## class EventLog
Bases: EventsListBase

Persistent event log with locking for concurrent writes. This class provides thread-safe and process-safe event storage using the FileStore's locking mechanism. Events are persisted to disk and can be accessed by index or event ID.

### Methods

**NOTE:** For LocalFileStore, file locking via flock() does NOT work reliably on NFS mounts or network filesystems. Users deploying with shared storage should use alternative coordination mechanisms.

#### init()

#### append()
Append an event with locking for thread/process safety.

**Raises:**
- TimeoutError – If the lock cannot be acquired within LOCK_TIMEOUT_SECONDS.
- ValueError – If an event with the same ID already exists.

#### get_id()
Return the event_id for a given index.

#### get_index()
Return the integer index for a given event_id.

---

## class EventsListBase
Bases: Sequence[Event], ABC

Abstract base class for event lists that can be appended to. This provides a common interface for both local EventLog and remote RemoteEventsList implementations, avoiding circular imports in protocols.

### Methods

#### abstractmethod append()
Add a new event to the list.

---

#### ask_agent()
Ask the agent a simple, stateless question and get a direct LLM response. This bypasses the normal conversation flow and does not modify, persist, or become part of the conversation state. The request is not remembered by the main agent, no events are recorded, and execution status is untouched. It is also thread-safe and may be called while conversation.run() is executing in another thread.

**Parameters:**
- `question` – A simple string question to ask the agent

**Returns:** A string response from the agent

#### close()
Close the conversation and clean up all tool executors.

#### condense()
Synchronously force condense the conversation history. If the agent is currently running, condense() will wait for the ongoing step to finish before proceeding. Raises ValueError if no compatible condenser exists.

#### property conversation_stats

#### generate_title()
Generate a title for the conversation based on the first user message.

**Parameters:**
- `llm` – Optional LLM to use for title generation. If not provided, uses self.agent.llm.
- `max_length` – Maximum length of the generated title.

**Returns:** A generated title for the conversation.

**Raises:** ValueError – If no user messages are found in the conversation.

#### pause()
Pause agent execution. This method can be called from any thread to request that the agent pause execution. The pause will take effect at the next iteration of the run loop (between agent steps). Note: If called during an LLM completion, the pause will not take effect until the current LLM call completes.

#### reject_pending_actions()
Reject all pending actions from the agent. This is a non-invasive method to reject actions between run() calls. Also clears the agent_waiting_for_confirmation flag.

#### run()
Runs the conversation until the agent finishes. In confirmation mode:
- First call: creates actions but doesn't execute them, stops and waits
- Second call: executes pending actions (implicit confirmation)

In normal mode:
- Creates and executes actions immediately
- Can be paused between steps

#### send_message()
Send a message to the agent.

**Parameters:**
- `message` – Either a string (which will be converted to a user message) or a Message object
- `sender` – Optional identifier of the sender. Can be used to track message origin in multi-agent scenarios. For example, when one agent delegates to another, the sender can be set to identify which agent is sending the message.

#### set_confirmation_policy()
Set the confirmation policy and store it in conversation state.

#### set_security_analyzer()
Set the security analyzer for the conversation.

#### update_secrets()
Add secrets to the conversation.

**Parameters:**

#### ask_agent()
Ask the agent a simple, stateless question and get a direct LLM response. This bypasses the normal conversation flow and does not modify, persist, or become part of the conversation state. The request is not remembered by the main agent, no events are recorded, and execution status is untouched. It is also thread-safe and may be called while conversation.run() is executing in another thread.

**Parameters:**
- `question` – A simple string question to ask the agent

**Returns:** A string response from the agent

#### close()
Close the conversation and clean up resources. Note: We don't close self._client here because it's shared with the workspace. The workspace owns the client and will close it during its own cleanup. Closing it here would prevent the workspace from making cleanup API calls.

#### condense()
Force condensation of the conversation history. This method sends a condensation request to the remote agent server. The server will use the existing condensation request pattern to trigger condensation if a condenser is configured and handles condensation requests. The condensation will be applied on the server side and will modify the conversation state by adding a condensation event to the history.

**Raises:** HTTPError – If the server returns an error (e.g., no condenser configured).

#### property conversation_stats

#### generate_title()
Generate a title for the conversation based on the first user message.

**Parameters:**
- `llm` – Optional LLM to use for title generation. If provided, its usage_id will be sent to the server. If not provided, uses the agent's LLM.
- `max_length` – Maximum length of the generated title.

**Returns:** A generated title for the conversation.

#### pause()

#### reject_pending_actions()

#### run()
Trigger a run on the server.

**Parameters:**
- `blocking` – If True (default), wait for the run to complete by polling the server. If False, return immediately after triggering the run.
- `poll_interval` – Time in seconds between status polls (only used when blocking=True). Default is 1.0 second.
- `timeout` – Maximum time in seconds to wait for the run to complete (only used when blocking=True). Default is 3600 seconds.

**Raises:** ConversationRunError – If the run fails or times out.

#### send_message()
Send a message to the agent.

**Parameters:**
- `message` – Either a string (which will be converted to a user message) or a Message object
- `sender` – Optional identifier of the sender. Can be used to track message origin in multi-agent scenarios. For example, when one agent delegates to another, the sender can be set to identify which agent is sending the message.

#### set_confirmation_policy()
Set the confirmation policy for the conversation.

#### set_security_analyzer()
Set the security analyzer for the remote conversation.

#### property stuck_detector
Stuck detector for compatibility. Not implemented for remote conversations.

#### update_secrets()

---

## class SecretRegistry
Bases: OpenHandsModel

Manages secrets and injects them into bash commands when needed. The secret registry stores a mapping of secret keys to SecretSources that retrieve the actual secret values. When a bash command is about to be executed, it scans the command for any secret keys and injects the corresponding environment variables.

Secret sources will redact / encrypt their sensitive values as appropriate when serializing, depending on the content of the context. If a context is present and contains a 'cipher' object, this is used for encryption. If it contains a boolean 'expose_secrets' flag set to True, secrets are dunped in plain text. Otherwise secrets are redacted.

Additionally, it tracks the latest exported values to enable consistent masking even when callable secrets fail on subsequent calls.

### Properties

- **secret_sources**: dict[str, SecretSource]

### Methods

#### find_secrets_in_text()
Find all secret keys mentioned in the given text.

**Parameters:**
- `text` – The text to search for secret keys

**Returns:** Set of secret keys found in the text

#### get_secrets_as_env_vars()
Get secrets that should be exported as environment variables for a command.

**Parameters:**
- `command` – The bash command to check for secret references

**Returns:** Dictionary of environment variables to export (key -> value)

#### mask_secrets_in_output()
Mask secret values in the given text. This method uses both the current exported values and attempts to get fresh values from callables to ensure comprehensive masking.

**Parameters:**
- `text` – The text to mask secrets in

**Returns:** Text with secret values replaced by <secret-hidden>

#### model_config
Configuration for the model, should be a dictionary conforming to [ConfigDict][pydantic.config.ConfigDict].

#### model_post_init()
This function is meant to behave like a BaseModel method to initialise private attributes. It takes context as an argument since that's what pydantic-core passes when calling it.

**Parameters:**
- `self` – The BaseModel instance.
- `context` – The context.

#### update_secrets()
Add or update secrets in the manager.

**Parameters:**
- `secrets` – Dictionary mapping secret keys to either string values or callable functions that return string values
