# openhands.sdk.agent

## class Agent
Bases: AgentBase

Main agent implementation for OpenHands. The Agent class provides the core functionality for running AI agents that can interact with tools, process messages, and execute actions. It inherits from AgentBase and implements the agent execution logic.

### Example

```python
from openhands.sdk import LLM, Agent, Tool

llm = LLM(model="claude-sonnet-4-20250514", api_key=SecretStr("key"))
tools = [Tool(name="TerminalTool"), Tool(name="FileEditorTool")]
agent = Agent(llm=llm, tools=tools)
```

### Properties

- **model_config**: Configuration for the model, should be a dictionary conforming to [ConfigDict][pydantic.config.ConfigDict].

### Methods

#### init_state()
Initialize the empty conversation state to prepare the agent for user messages. Typically this involves adding system message.

**Note:** state will be mutated in-place.

#### model_post_init()
This function is meant to behave like a BaseModel method to initialise private attributes. It takes context as an argument since that's what pydantic-core passes when calling it.

**Parameters:**
- `self` – The BaseModel instance.
- `context` – The context.

#### step()
Taking a step in the conversation. Typically this involves:
1. Making a LLM call
2. Executing the tool
3. Updating the conversation state with LLM calls (role="assistant") and tool results (role="tool")
   - 4.1 If conversation is finished, set state.execution_status to FINISHED
   - 4.2 Otherwise, just return, Conversation will kick off the next step

If the underlying LLM supports streaming, partial deltas are forwarded to on_token before the full response is returned.

**Note:** state will be mutated in-place.

## class AgentBase
Bases: DiscriminatedUnionMixin, ABC

Abstract base class for OpenHands agents. Agents are stateless and should be fully defined by their configuration. This base class provides the common interface and functionality that all agent implementations must follow.

### Properties

- **agent_context**: AgentContext | None
- **condenser**: CondenserBase | None
- **critic**: CriticBase | None
- **filter_tools_regex**: str | None
- **include_default_tools**: list[str]
- **llm**: LLM
- **mcp_config**: dict[str, Any]
- **model_config**: Configuration for the model, should be a dictionary conforming to [ConfigDict][pydantic.config.ConfigDict].
- **name**: str - Returns the name of the Agent.
- **prompt_dir**: str - Returns the directory where this class's module file is located.
- **security_policy_filename**: str
- **system_message**: str - Compute system message on-demand to maintain statelessness.
- **system_prompt_filename**: str
- **system_prompt_kwargs**: dict[str, object]
- **tools**: list[Tool]
- **tools_map**: dict[str, [ToolDefinition]] - Get the initialized tools map.
  - **Raises:** RuntimeError: If the agent has not been initialized.

### Methods

#### get_all_llms()
Recursively yield unique base-class LLM objects reachable from self. Returns actual object references (not copies). De-dupes by id(LLM). Cycle-safe via a visited set for all traversed objects. Only yields objects whose type is exactly LLM (no subclasses). Does not handle dataclasses.

#### init_state()
Initialize the empty conversation state to prepare the agent for user messages. Typically this involves adding system message.

**Note:** state will be mutated in-place.

#### model_dump_succint()
Like model_dump, but excludes None fields by default.

#### model_post_init()
This function is meant to behave like a BaseModel method to initialise private attributes. It takes context as an argument since that's what pydantic-core passes when calling it.

**Parameters:**
- `self` – The BaseModel instance.
- `context` – The context.

#### abstractmethod step()
Taking a step in the conversation. Typically this involves:
1. Making a LLM call
2. Executing the tool
3. Updating the conversation state with LLM calls (role="assistant") and tool results (role="tool")
   - 4.1 If conversation is finished, set state.execution_status to FINISHED
   - 4.2 Otherwise, just return, Conversation will kick off the next step

If the underlying LLM supports streaming, partial deltas are forwarded to on_token before the full response is returned.

**Note:** state will be mutated in-place.

#### verify()
Verify that we can resume this agent from persisted state. This PR's goal is to not reconcile configuration between persisted and runtime Agent instances. Instead, we verify compatibility requirements and then continue with the runtime-provided Agent.

**Compatibility requirements:**
- Agent class/type must match.
- Tools: If events are provided, only tools that were actually used in history must exist in runtime. If events are not provided, tool names must match exactly.
- All other configuration (LLM, agent_context, condenser, system prompts, etc.) can be freely changed between sessions.

**Parameters:**
- `persisted` – The agent loaded from persisted state.
- `events` – Optional event sequence to scan for used tools if tool names don't match.

**Returns:** This runtime agent (self) if verification passes.

**Raises:** ValueError – If agent class or tools don't match.
